## Operator Description

### Computational Function

This example implements 2D convolution forward calculation:

$$
Y = X * K
$$

where `*` denotes the convolution operation. The input matrix formats are as follows:

- `X` is of shape `[batch, cin, hin, win, c0]`
- `K` is in `Fractal_Z` format: `[cin * hk * wk, n/16, 16, c0]`
- `Y` is of shape `[batch, n/c0, hout, wout, c0]`
- `hout = (hin + padTop + padBottom - dilationH * (hk - 1) - 1) / strideH + 1`
- `wout = (win + padLeft + padRight - dilationW * (wk - 1) - 1) / strideW + 1`

The default reference configuration in `main.cpp` is `X=[4, 32, 16, 96, 16], K=[288, 384, 16, 16], Y=[4, 384, 16, 96, 16], strideH=strideW=1, dilationH=dilationW=1, padTop=padBottom=padLeft=padRight=1`.

## Optimization Details

This example uses the 24-core A3 platform for performance verification.

-   **Multi-core Partitioning (core partitioning)**: Split the workload among Cube cores to maximize parallelism.It is generally not recommended to further split `k` within a single core. Instead, `m` and `n` are distributed across the 24 cores. This example uses a `4 × 6` grouping, corresponding to `singleCoreM=1536`, `singleCoreK=4608`, and `singleCoreN=1024`.
-   **Base block selection (base block selection)**: Choose a base block that offers a higher compute-to-memory-access ratio and better fits the on-chip capacity and alignment constraints. For FP16, a common choice is `[baseM, baseN, baseK] = [128, 256, 48]`. Compared to `[128, 128, 128]`, it provides higher arithmetic intensity and is easier to maintain 512-byte alignment for GM write-back.
-   **L1 caching (L1 caching)**: Load multiple base blocks from GM to L1 in one go to improve bandwidth utilization. In this example, `stepKa=stepKb=3`, meaning 3 `k` blocks are cached at a time.
-   **Double buffering (double buffering)**: Enable double buffering in L1/L0A/L0B to overlap DMA operations with computation as much as possible.

## Build and Run

1. Configure the Ascend CANN environment:

```bash
source ${ASCEND_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/setenv.bash
```

2. Generate input + golden output:

```bash
cd ${git_clone_path}/kernels/manual/a2a3/conv2d_forward
python3 scripts/gen_data.py
```

3. Run the example:

```bash
bash run.sh -r npu -v Ascend910B1
```

If the run succeeds, the output prints:

```text
test success
```
