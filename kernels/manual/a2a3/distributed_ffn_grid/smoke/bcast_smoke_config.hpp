// Compile-time config for the GridPipe single-source broadcast smoke kernel.
//
// One source cell broadcasts a stamped fp32 tile to every other cell on its
// span (TPUSH<ROW> = the whole row, TPUSH<COL> = the whole column) in a single
// multicast op (batched writes + ONE publish fence + batched doorbells, not a
// per-hop TPUSH loop).  Each receiver drains the broadcast with the ordinary
// TPOP<dir, dist> toward the source and stores it.  Fan-in stays 1.
//
// Default: a 1 x 5 row with the source in the MIDDLE (col 2) so BOTH arms of the
// row broadcast are exercised in one run -- cols 3,4 receive via the EAST arm
// (dist 1,2) and cols 0,1 via the WEST arm (dist 2,1).  Flip to a column
// broadcast with -DCONFIG_BCAST_SPAN_COL=1 and a Rx1 grid.
