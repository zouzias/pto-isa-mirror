# Pipeline Sync

These `pto.*` forms establish explicit producer-consumer ordering across PTO execution stages. They belong to the scalar and control instructions even when they coordinate vector-facing pipelines, because what they expose architecturally is dependency state rather than vector payload math.

## Synchronization Hierarchy

The four synchronization modes form a containment hierarchy:

```
Event-based synchronization  (set_flag / wait_flag)
        ↑
Buffer-token protocol  (get_buf / rls_buf)  — requires event-based under the hood
        ↑
Memory barrier  (mem_bar)  — may be used inside vector-visible scope
        ↑
Inter-core coordination  (set_cross_core / wait_flag_dev / set_intra_block / wait_intra_core)
```

- **Event-based** (`set_flag` / `wait_flag`): The foundational mode. Sets or waits on a named event signal between producer and consumer pipes. Used as the primitive for all higher-level modes.
- **Buffer-token** (`get_buf` / `rls_buf`): A protocol built on top of event-based synchronization for double-buffered execution. `get_buf` acquires a buffer token and implicitly sets an event; `rls_buf` releases the token and implicitly sets a dependent event.
- **Memory barrier** (`mem_bar`): Enforces visibility of memory operations within a vector-visible execution scope. Does not establish cross-stage ordering on its own.
- **Inter-core** (`set_cross_core` / `wait_flag_dev` / `set_intra_block` / `wait_intra_core`): Coordinate between execution units or cores. These are profile-restricted and **MAY NOT** be available on all targets.

Programs **MUST NOT** assume that a higher-level mode (e.g., buffer-token) replaces the need for event-based ordering; the protocol requires event-based synchronization underneath.
