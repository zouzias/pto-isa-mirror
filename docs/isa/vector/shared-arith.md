# Vector Instruction Set: Shared Scalar Arithmetic

Vector programs in PTO rely on the shared MLIR `arith` instruction set for scalar setup around `pto.v*` regions. The relationship is kept explicit here without treating scalar bookkeeping as a vector payload instruction set.

## Summary

Shared scalar arithmetic is part of the documented PTO source instruction set. It feeds vector regions with constants, offsets, loop bounds, and scalar predicates, but it does not replace `pto.v*` compute.

## Mechanism

Around vector code, `arith` is used to:

- compute UB offsets and loop counters
- derive tail counts and active-lane conditions
- build scalar values broadcast or materialized into vector state
- compare scalar loop/control values that guard vector regions

The canonical scalar-side explanation lives in [Scalar And Control Instruction Set: Shared Scalar Arithmetic](../scalar/shared-arith.md). This vector reference keeps the surrounding scalar setup visible without duplicating the scalar-side contract.

## Inputs

- scalar integers
- scalar floating-point values
- `index` values
- boolean-like results from scalar comparisons

## Expected Outputs

- scalar values consumed by vector configuration or control
- branch predicates for structured control around vector scopes
- scalar operands later materialized into vector state

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    - `arith` MUST remain scalar; vector payload math belongs to `pto.v*`.
    - Width changes, `index` conversions, and scalar comparisons that affect vector legality SHOULD be spelled explicitly.
    - This shared instruction set MUST be documented as supporting source syntax, not as hidden compiler-only machinery.

## Cases That Are Not Allowed

!!! danger "Cases That Are Not Allowed"
    - documenting scalar setup as if it were a vector ALU instruction set
    - using `arith` to stand in for vector-register semantics
    - leaving scalar-to-vector boundary assumptions implicit
