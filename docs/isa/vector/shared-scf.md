# Vector Instruction Set: Shared Structured Control Flow

Vector code in PTO is surrounded by structured control, not by hidden launch magic. The control shell that wraps `pto.v*` execution is described here without treating `scf` as a vector mnemonic instruction set.

## Summary

Shared `scf` operations provide the loop and branch structure around vector regions. They keep vector execution analyzable, explicit, and compatible with the rest of the PTO manual.

## Mechanism

Around vector regions, `scf` is used to:

- iterate over repeated vector work
- carry scalar state across iterations
- branch around target-specific vector paths
- model vector execution scopes using structured regions instead of opaque launch syntax

The canonical scalar-side explanation lives in [Scalar And Control Instruction Set: Shared Structured Control Flow](../scalar/shared-scf.md). The vector-side reference keeps that relationship visible along the `pto.v*` path.

## Inputs

- scalar loop bounds
- scalar predicates
- loop-carried SSA values
- yielded state from vector-adjacent branches or loops

## Expected Outputs

- explicit structured regions around vector work
- loop-carried scalar or stateful results
- analyzable control boundaries for vector lowering

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    - Vector-side control MUST keep carried values and branch results explicit through `scf.yield`.
    - Structured control SHOULD remain in `scf` form unless a truly architecture-visible PTO synchronization mechanism is required.
    - The manual MUST distinguish between vector payload effects and the shared control shell that surrounds them.

## Cases That Are Not Allowed

!!! danger "Cases That Are Not Allowed"
    - treating structured control as backend-only hidden behavior
    - collapsing vector loop state into vague prose instead of explicit carried SSA values
    - documenting `scf` as though it were a `pto.v*` opcode instruction set
