# pto.vneg

`pto.vneg` is part of the [Unary Vector Instructions](../../unary-vector-ops.md) instruction set.

## Summary

`%result` is the lane-wise arithmetic negation.

## Mechanism

`pto.vneg` computes the lane-wise arithmetic negation. For each lane `i` where the predicate is true, `dst[i] = -src[i]`. This is implemented via the scalar-multiply hardware path with a -1 multiplier. Inactive lanes leave the destination unchanged.

## Syntax

### PTO Assembly Form

```text
vneg %result, %input, %mask
```

### AS Level 1 (SSA)

```mlir
%result = pto.vneg %input, %mask : !pto.vreg<NxT>, !pto.mask -> !pto.vreg<NxT>
```

Documented A5 types or forms: `i8-i32, f16, f32`.

## Inputs

| Operand | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `%input` | `!pto.vreg<NxT>` | Source vector register; read at each active lane `i` |
| `%mask` | `!pto.mask` | Predicate mask; lanes where mask bit is 1 (true) are active |

## Expected Outputs

| Result | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `%result` | `!pto.vreg<NxT>` | Lane-wise arithmetic negation: `dst[i] = -src[i]` on active lanes; inactive lanes are unmodified |

## Side Effects

This operation has no architectural side effect beyond producing its SSA results. It does not implicitly reserve buffers, signal events, or establish memory fences unless the form says so.

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    Source and result types MUST match.

## Exceptions

!!! danger "Exceptions"
    - The verifier rejects illegal operand shapes, unsupported element types, and attribute combinations that are not valid for the selected instruction set or target profile.
    - Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

??? info "Target-Profile Restrictions"
    - Documented A5 coverage: `i8-i32, f16, f32`.
    - A5 is the most detailed concrete profile in the current manual; CPU simulation and A2/A3-class targets may support narrower subsets or emulate the behavior while preserving the visible PTO contract.
    - Code that depends on an instruction-set-specific type list, distribution mode, or fused form should treat that dependency as target-profile-specific unless the PTO manual states cross-target portability explicitly.

## Performance

### A5 Latency

| Element Type | Latency (cycles) | A5 RV |
|---|---|---|
| `f32` | 8 | `RV_VMULS` (scalar-mul path) |
| `f16` | 8 | `RV_VMULS` (scalar-mul path) |
| `i32` | 8 | `RV_VMULS` (scalar-mul path) |
| `i16` | 8 | `RV_VMULS` (scalar-mul path) |

### A2/A3 Throughput

| Metric | Value | Constant |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Startup latency | 14 | `A2A3_STARTUP_BINARY` |
| Completion latency | 20 (FP) / 18 (INT) | `A2A3_COMPL_FP_MUL` / `A2A3_COMPL_INT_MUL` |
| Per-repeat throughput | 1 | `A2A3_RPT_1` |
| Pipeline interval | 18 | `A2A3_INTERVAL` |

## Examples

### C Semantics

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dst[i] = -src[i];
```

`vneg` is implemented via the scalar-multiply (`RV_VMULS`) hardware path with a -1 scalar, giving it the same latency as scalar multiplication.
