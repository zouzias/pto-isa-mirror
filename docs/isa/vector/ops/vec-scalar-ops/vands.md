# pto.vands

`pto.vands` is part of the [Vector-Scalar Instructions](../../vec-scalar-ops.md) instruction set.

## Summary

Lane-wise bitwise AND of a vector register and a broadcast scalar.

## Mechanism

For each active lane `i`, `dst[i] = src[i] & scalar`. The scalar is broadcast to every active lane. Inactive lanes do not participate in the operation.

## Syntax

### PTO Assembly Form

```text
vands %dst, %src, %scalar, %mask : !pto.vreg<NxT>, T
```

### AS Level 1 (SSA)

```mlir
%result = pto.vands %input, %scalar, %mask : !pto.vreg<NxT>, T, !pto.mask -> !pto.vreg<NxT>
```

## Inputs

| Operand | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| %input | `!pto.vreg<NxT>` | Source vector register |
| %scalar | `T` | Scalar bit mask broadcast to every active lane |
| %mask | `!pto.mask` | Predicate mask; only lanes with mask bit 1 participate |

## Expected Outputs

| Result | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| %result | `!pto.vreg<NxT>` | Lane-wise bitwise AND result on the active lanes |

## Side Effects

This operation has no architectural side effect beyond producing its destination values. It does not implicitly reserve buffers, signal events, or establish memory fences.

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    - Bitwise forms are defined for integer element types only.
    - `%input` and `%result` MUST have the same vector width `N` and element type `T`.
    - The mask width MUST match `N`.

## Exceptions

!!! danger "Exceptions"
    - The verifier rejects illegal operand shapes, unsupported element types, and attribute combinations that are not valid for the selected instruction set or target profile.
    - Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

??? info "Target-Profile Restrictions"
    - Integer element types only.
    - A5 is the most detailed concrete profile in the current manual; CPU simulation and A2/A3-class targets may support narrower subsets or emulate the behavior while preserving the visible PTO contract.

## Examples

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    if (mask[i])
        dst[i] = src[i] & scalar;
```

```mlir
%result = pto.vands %values, %bitmask, %mask : !pto.vreg<64xi32>, i32, !pto.mask -> !pto.vreg<64xi32>
```
