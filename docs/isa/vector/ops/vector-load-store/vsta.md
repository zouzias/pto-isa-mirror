# pto.vsta

`pto.vsta` is part of the [Vector Load Store](../../vector-load-store.md) instruction set.

## Summary

Flush alignment state to memory.

## Mechanism

`pto.vsta` is part of the PTO vector memory/data-movement instruction set. It keeps UB addressing, distribution, mask behavior, and any alignment-state threading explicit in SSA form rather than hiding those details in backend-specific lowering.

## Syntax

### PTO Assembly Form

```text
vsta %value, %dest[%offset]
```

### AS Level 1 (SSA)

```mlir
pto.vsta %value, %dest[%offset] : !pto.align, !pto.ptr<T, ub>, index
```

## Inputs

`%value` is the pending store-alignment state, `%dest` is the UB base pointer,
  and `%offset` is the flush displacement.

## Expected Outputs

This op writes buffered tail bytes to UB and returns no SSA value.

## Side Effects

This operation writes UB-visible memory and/or updates streamed alignment state. Stateful unaligned forms expose their evolving state in SSA form, but a trailing flush form may still be required to complete the stream.

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    The flush address MUST match the post-updated address expected by the
      preceding unaligned-store stream. After the flush, the corresponding store
      alignment state is consumed.

## Exceptions

!!! danger "Exceptions"
    - It is illegal to use addresses outside the required UB-visible space or to violate the alignment/distribution contract of the selected form.
    - Masked-off lanes or inactive blocks do not make an otherwise-illegal address valid unless the operation text explicitly says so.
    - Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

??? info "Target-Profile Restrictions"
    - A5 is the most detailed concrete profile in the current manual; CPU simulation and A2/A3-class targets may support narrower subsets or emulate the behavior while preserving the visible PTO contract.
    - Code that depends on an instruction-set-specific type list, distribution mode, or fused form should treat that dependency as target-profile-specific unless the PTO manual states cross-target portability explicitly.

## Performance

### Timing Disclosure

The current public VPTO timing material for PTO micro instructions remains limited.
For `pto.vsta`, those public sources describe the instruction semantics, operand legality, and pipeline placement, but they do **not** publish a numeric latency or steady-state throughput.

| Metric | Status | Source Basis |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A5 latency | Not publicly published | Current public VPTO timing material |
| Steady-state throughput | Not publicly published | Current public VPTO timing material |

If software scheduling or performance modeling depends on the exact cost of `pto.vsta`, treat that cost as target-profile-specific and measure it on the concrete backend rather than inferring a manual constant.

## Examples

```mlir
pto.vsta %value, %dest[%offset] : !pto.align, !pto.ptr<T, ub>, index
```
