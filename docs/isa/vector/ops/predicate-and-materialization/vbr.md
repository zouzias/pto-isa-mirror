# pto.vbr

`pto.vbr` is part of the [Predicate And Materialization](../../predicate-and-materialization.md) instruction set.

## Summary

Broadcast scalar to all vector lanes.

## Mechanism

`pto.vbr` materializes scalar or selected-lane state into a vector register. The architectural result is a new vector-register value, so the operation stays in the `pto.v*` instruction set even when its input is scalar.

## Syntax

### PTO Assembly Form

```text
vbr %result, %value
```

### AS Level 1 (SSA)

```mlir
%result = pto.vbr %value : T -> !pto.vreg<NxT>
```

## Inputs

`%value` is the scalar source.

## Expected Outputs

`%result` is a vector whose active lanes all carry `%value`.

## Side Effects

This operation has no architectural side effect beyond producing its SSA results. It does not implicitly reserve buffers, signal events, or establish memory fences unless the form says so.

## Constraints

!!! warning "Constraints"
    Supported forms are `b8`, `b16`, and `b32`. For `b8`, only the low 8 bits of
      the scalar source are consumed.

## Exceptions

!!! danger "Exceptions"
    - The verifier rejects illegal operand shapes, unsupported element types, and attribute combinations that are not valid for the selected instruction set or target profile.
    - Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

??? info "Target-Profile Restrictions"
    - A5 is the most detailed concrete profile in the current manual; CPU simulation and A2/A3-class targets may support narrower subsets or emulate the behavior while preserving the visible PTO contract.
    - Code that depends on an instruction-set-specific type list, distribution mode, or fused form should treat that dependency as target-profile-specific unless the PTO manual states cross-target portability explicitly.

## Performance

### Timing Disclosure

The current public VPTO timing material for PTO micro instructions remains limited.
For `pto.vbr`, those public sources describe the instruction semantics, operand legality, and pipeline placement, but they do **not** publish a numeric latency or steady-state throughput.

| Metric | Status | Source Basis |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A5 latency | Not publicly published | Current public VPTO timing material |
| Steady-state throughput | Not publicly published | Current public VPTO timing material |

If software scheduling or performance modeling depends on the exact cost of `pto.vbr`, treat that cost as target-profile-specific and measure it on the concrete backend rather than inferring a manual constant.

## Examples

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dst[i] = value;
```

```mlir
%one = pto.vbr %c1_f32 : f32 -> !pto.vreg<64xf32>
```

## Detailed Notes

```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    dst[i] = value;
```

**Example:**
```mlir
%one = pto.vbr %c1_f32 : f32 -> !pto.vreg<64xf32>
```
