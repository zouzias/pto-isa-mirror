# PTO Tile Library

Parallel Tile Operation (PTO) is a virtual instruction set architecture designed by Ascend CANN, focusing on tile-level operations. This repository offers high-performance, cross-platform tile operations across Ascend platforms. By porting to PTO instruction sequences, users can migrate Ascend hardware more easily.

## Overview

The PTO ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is built on Ascend’s underlying hardware and software abstractions, providing over 90 standard tile-level operations.

Ascend hardware architectures have significantly evolved over generations, leading to major changes in the instruction sets. The PTO instruction set bridges these hardware differences by raising the abstraction level. We ensure that these PTO instructions work correctly across platforms while maintaining backward compatibility. However, this abstraction does not hide performance tuning opportunities. Users can still fine-tune performance by adjusting tile sizes, tile shapes, instruction order, etc. This provides sufficient control to fine-tune internal pipeline flows.

Our goal is to offer users a simplified, yet powerful way to optimize performance, enabling them to write high-performance code with PTO instructions.

## How to Use PTO Tile Library

PTO instructions support two modes: **Auto Mode (Available only in CPU simulation)** (where the user does not allocate buffers or manage pipelining) and **Manual Mode** (where the user must allocate buffer addresses and manage pipelining). We recommend the following steps for optimizing operators:

1. Develop the operator based on Auto Mode, generating PTO instruction sequences according to the algorithm logic. See [demos/auto_mode/baseline/add](demos/auto_mode/baseline/add/README.md) for an example.
2. Verify functionality and correctness in CPU simulation (see [Run CPU Simulator](#run-cpu-simulator-recommended-first-step)).
3. Port the code to Ascend hardware to ensure correctness and collect performance data. See the [msprof tool](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/canncommercial/850/devaids/Profiling/atlasprofiling_16_0010.html).
4. Identify performance bottlenecks (CUBE Bound / MTE Bound / Vector Bound) and begin optimization and tuning. See [Performance Optimization](docs/coding/opt.md).

We ensure that each PTO instruction, when implemented within a fixed tile shape, fully leverages the capabilities of the underlying hardware. We encapsulate low-level hardware implementations into the tile abstractions and utilize expert knowledge to create a variety of tile templates. During static compilation, the compiler selects the best assembly implementation for the current shape based on template parameters. By merging different PTO instructions, we achieve optimal performance.

In this repository, we demonstrate how standard tile operations can be mapped to various pipelines through template parameters:

* Static tile Shape (Row, Col): [Tile Programming Model](docs/coding/Tile.md)
* Dynamic tile Mask (Valid Mask): [Tile Programming Model](docs/coding/Tile.md)
* Event Record & Wait (Set wait flag): [Events and Synchronization](docs/coding/Event.md), [General Conventions](docs/isa/conventions.md)
* Specialized Fixed Function (SFU)
* Fixed Pipeline (FIXP)

PTO ISA defines over 90 standard operations. See the [PTO instruction list](docs/isa/README.md). This repository implements a growing subset of them, with ongoing efforts to add more.

## Quickstart Guide

For detailed, OS-specific setup (Windows / Linux / macOS), see: [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

### Build Documentation (MkDocs)

This repository includes comprehensive API documentation and ISA instruction references built with MkDocs (Material theme) under `docs/mkdocs/`. The documentation covers:

* Complete PTO ISA instruction reference
* API usage guidelines and examples
* Performance tuning guides
* Architecture and design documentation

#### Access Online Documentation

For the latest documentation, visit the [Documentation Center](https://pto-isa.gitcode.com).

#### Build Documentation Locally

Build locally if you need offline access, are working on documentation changes, or want to view unreleased features.

#### Prerequisites

* Python >= 3.8
* pip (Python package manager)

#### Quick Start with MkDocs CLI

1. Install MkDocs and dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
```

1. Choose one of the following options:

##### Serve documentation locally (for development/preview)

```bash
python -m mkdocs serve -f docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml
```

The documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The server watches for file changes and automatically reloads. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

##### Build static HTML site (for offline use/deployment)

```bash
python -m mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml
```

Output will be in `docs/mkdocs/site/`. Open `docs/mkdocs/site/index.html` in your browser.

#### Build via CMake (Advanced)

This method is useful for CI/CD pipelines or when integrating documentation builds into your development workflow.

1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-mkdocs
source .venv-mkdocs/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv-mkdocs\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
```

1. Configure and build with CMake:

```bash
cmake -S docs -B build/docs -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$PWD/.venv-mkdocs/bin/python
cmake --build build/docs --target pto_docs
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cmake -S docs -B build/docs -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$PWD\.venv-mkdocs\Scripts\python.exe"
cmake --build build/docs --target pto_docs
```

The built documentation will be in `build/docs/site/`.

### Run CPU Simulator (recommended first step)

CPU simulation is cross-platform and does not require Ascend drivers/CANN:

```bash
python3 tests/run_cpu.py --clean --verbose
```

Build & run the GEMM demo (optional):

```bash
python3 tests/run_cpu.py --demo gemm --verbose
```

Build & run the Flash Attention demo (optional):

```bash
python3 tests/run_cpu.py --demo flash_attn --verbose
```

### Running a Single ST Test Case

Running ST requires a working Ascend CANN environment and is typically Linux-only.

```bash
python3 tests/script/run_st.py -r [sim|npu] -v [a3|a5] -t [TEST_CASE] -g [GTEST_FILTER_CASE]
```

Note: the `a3` backend covers the A2/A3 family (`include/pto/npu/a2a3`).

Example:

```bash
python3 tests/script/run_st.py -r npu -v a3 -t tmatmul -g TMATMULTest.case1
python3 tests/script/run_st.py -r sim -v a5 -t tmatmul -g TMATMULTest.case1
```

### Running Recommended Test Suites

```bash
# Execute the following commands from the project root directory:
chmod +x ./tests/run_st.sh
./tests/run_st.sh a5 npu simple
./tests/run_st.sh a3 sim all
```

### Running CPU Simulation Tests

```bash
# Execute the following commands from the project root directory:
chmod +x ./tests/run_cpu_tests.sh
./tests/run_cpu_tests.sh

python3 tests/run_cpu.py --verbose
```

## Build / Run Instructions

### Configuring Environment Variables (Ascend CANN)

For example, if you use the CANN community package and install to the default path:

* Default path (installed as root)

  ```bash
  source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/bin/setenv.bash
  ```

* Default path (installed as a non-root user)

  ```bash
  source $HOME/Ascend/cann/bin/setenv.bash
  ```

If you install to `install-path`, use:

```bash
source ${install-path}/cann/bin/setenv.bash
```

### One-click Build and Run

* Run Full ST Tests:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh --run_all --a3 --sim
```

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh --run_simple --a5 --npu
```

* Packaging:

```bash
